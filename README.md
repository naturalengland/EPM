# England Peat Map
The England Peat Map is a set of map layers describing the extent, depth and condition of England’s peat resources. It was created primarily to support delivery of the 2021 England Peat Action Plan and is useful across a range of other policy and delivery activities.   

The map layers were created using machine learning and deep learning modelling techniques, trained with pre-existing survey data collated from Defra organisations and other stakeholders, as well as new survey data collected by contractors and quality-assured by an in-house team. Predictor data used in the modelling process included national-scale satellite imagery, topographic LiDAR, geological and historic land-use data.  

They are supported by reports and annexes available on the [Natural England Access to Evidence Catalogue](https://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/) and Defra’s [Science Search](https://sciencesearch.defra.gov.uk/). A User Guide is provided alongside this report giving summary information for end users about what the map layers mean, and how to access and use them.  England Peat Map outputs comprise maps of peaty soil extent, depth and vegetation across England, surface features (grips, gullies and haggs) and bare peaty soil in the English uplands, together with additional map layers describing accuracy and confidence. Maps and publishable data can be viewed and downloaded from the [England Peat Map Portal](https://england-peat-map-portal-ncea.hub.arcgis.com/) and soon on the [Natural England Open Data Geoportal](https://naturalengland-defra.opendata.arcgis.com/).  

The models and code which created these maps will be published shortly in [Natural England's GitHub](www.github.com/naturalengland/epm) account in the following repositories: 
- [EPM Peaty Soil Model](https://github.com/naturalengland/EPM_peaty_soil_v1)
